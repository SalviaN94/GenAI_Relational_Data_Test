# About
Gen AI POC where information comes from a MySQL database.

The idea behind the POC is analyse the possibility of insert data into the context obtained through an SQL Query. This Query will be generated by an AI using the information about the tables as context and the question asked by the user.

## Tools
- Ollama 0.2.5 with llama3 model
- MySQL 8.0.37
- Python 3.10.12

## To implement
- Restrictions into the context in order to prevent SQL Injection through user questions.
- Generation of more complex queries.
- Generate context about tables relations using an image of an ER model.
- UI to avoid modify the script every time.
